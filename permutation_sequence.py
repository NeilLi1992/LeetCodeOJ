# The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
#
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
# We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
#
#     "123"
#     "132"
#     "213"
#     "231"
#     "312"
#     "321"
#
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
#
# Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
